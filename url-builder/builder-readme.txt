This tool is built to let all countries be able to build url structures for tracking.

There are few things left to do to make this complete.

1. Need to get checks in for elements that needs to be filled out
2. Need to be able to add the final url to a database. Most likely a file that is json so that it can be placed into a Database that can be read into the Reachlocal Drupal site.
